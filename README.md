WARNING: If you have a large amount of items added using this mod and complete the mission without
having the mod active, then your account may be (temporarily?) disabled.

Run this application (will use port 80) and use localghost patcher with server
address `config.hitman.io.vcap.me` then launch the game.

Then start a mission with the normal coin in a slot. Exit to the main menu, then start the
mission again. You should now have additional items in the inventory.
